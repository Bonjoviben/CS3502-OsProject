The purpose of this project was to design and implement an OS Simulator; this simulator will run on a virtual CPU.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### UI\r\nThe UI consists of the main window that contains that console in which all System.out is routed to. On the main window the user can specify the number of CPU's to run the OS on as well as the Scheduling Type (First in First Out, Shortest Job First, and Non-Preemptive Priority) and the Sleep Time (in ms) for each CPU clock cycle.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/StephenStrickland/CS3502-OsProject/blob/master/Resources/Screenshot%202016-04-25%2021.25.42.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nOnce the OS is started a metrics dialog should display showing a grid of CPU's and their metrics, the overall OS metrics (Total Jobs, Jobs Completed, Jobs in Progress, Average Job Wait Time in ms, and Average Job Run Time in ms), and a table that contains metrics on the jobs currently running and/or completed.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/StephenStrickland/CS3502-OsProject/blob/master/Resources/Screenshot%202016-04-25%2021.23.26.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStephen Strickland (@stephenstrickland) <br />\r\nChris Koronkowski (@cakoronkowski) <br />\r\nJordan Madah-­Amiri (@jmadahamiri) <br />\r\nEthan Mitchell (@CleverNameHere)<br />\r\n",
